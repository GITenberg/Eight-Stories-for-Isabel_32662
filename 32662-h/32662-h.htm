  alt="steam boat" title="" /><br
 />STEAM BOAT.</h2>


<p>Here is a Steam Boat
sailing on the water.
How fast she moves.
She is carried along by
wheels. See the smoke
coming from the chimney.
There is a great
fire in the boat, and large
boilers, which hold sixty
hogsheads of water; and
when this water boils,
the steam comes from it
<a name="png.005" id="png.005" href="#png.005"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">3</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>so swift and strong that
it can be made to move
the great wheels which
are on the outside of the
boat, and these great
wheels have wide paddles
to them, that are
all the time beating
water back.</p>

  alt="chair" title="" /><br
 />THE CHAIR.</h2>


<p>You all know what
this picture is; a Chair.
It has a back and a seat
and four legs. I knew
a little girl that got upon
the back of a chair, when
her brother was sitting in
it eating his breakfast,
and he rose up as soon
as he had done, and the
<a name="png.007" id="png.007" href="#png.007"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">5</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>chair fell back to the
floor, and his little sister&#8217;s
head was so hurt
that she died. You
must never get upon the
back of a chair, nor pull
one away when any body
is going to sit down, for
the fall may break the
person&#8217;s back.</p>

 alt="sailing ship" title="" /><br
 />THE SHIP.</h2>


<p>This Ship is carried
along by the wind, which
blows against her white
sails, which you can see
all spread from the mast.</p>

<p>Her hull sits on the
water and slides along
throwing the waves on
each side.</p>


<p><a name="png.009" id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">7</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></a>The great Whale, and
the Porpoise, and the
hungry Sharks, all play
round the great Ship,
and seem to wonder
what mighty thing it is
that is swimming through
the sea and keeps always
on the top of the water,
not sinking down and
coming up again as they
do.</p>

 alt="well" title="" /><br
 />THE WELL.</h2>


<p>This is the picture of
a Well.<!-- period invisible in original --> It is pretty,
and all around it are
flowers growing upon its
grey and mossy stones.
It has a wheel, and bucket,
and a rope; and
water is got from it by
<a name="png.011" id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>putting down the bucket,
and pulling the rope over
the wheel.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of
the giddy Girl who fell
into the well, and of
naughty John Green
who threw the poor puss
into the well, and of good
Jack Stout who took
her out? You can read
their story in many
books.<!-- period invisible in original --></p>

 alt="heraldic device" title="" /><br
 />ARM AND HAMMER.</h2>


<p>This is the picture of
a very strong Arm, holding
a great hammer. It
is such arms as this that
do all the most useful<!-- original reads "uself" --> work
in the world. It must
be such an arm that beats
out the hard iron, that
hammers the rough stone
<a name="png.013" id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>and makes it smooth,
that cuts down with an
axe the largest trees, and
that builds all our houses.
It is this arm that guides
the plough and that mows
the grass, and that tames
the wild colt and the fiery
bull, and makes them
obedient, to drag our
carts and chaises.</p>

<p class="ctr bot2"><img src="images/illo-013.png" width="291" height="167"
 alt="dog" title="" /></p>

 /></span></a><img src="images/illo-014.png" width="264" height="304"
 alt="cat" title="" /><br
 />THE CAT.</h2>


<p>Puss is seeing her pretty
face in the looking-glass.
Perhaps she will
wash her face in the
bowl that stands by her
side.</p>

<p>Cats will always wash
their faces once a day,
<a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]
 </span></a>and look clean and neat,
and when they take a
walk out of doors, they
never step in the wet.
Little girls must keep
their shoes and frocks
and stockings and hands
and face clean, and never
play in the dirt.</p>

<p>Cats are not fond of
dogs. Her tail will puff
out as big as your arm,
when she sees one.<!-- period invisible in original --></p>

 />BROWN COW.</h2>


<p>God made the Cow,
the Cow gives milk, the<!-- original reads "the the" -->
 woman makes butter
and cheese from the
milk, and Children eat
butter, and cheese, and
milk. Cows cannot read
but you must read.</p>

<p>Here is a white Horse,
with his black mane and
long tail. He trots in
the chaise, he walks with
the tracks and the carts,
and he canters and gallops
in the saddle.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
